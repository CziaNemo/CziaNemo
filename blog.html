                <h2>Global warming</h2>
                <p>Some people look at it as a hoax, but Global Warming is real. “Climate change” and “global warming” are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings. Similarly, the terms "weather" and "climate" are sometimes confused, though they refer to events with broadly different spatial- and timescales.</p>
                <img src="assets/blog1.jpeg" alt="global warming chart" class="img-blog">
                <p>Weather refers to atmospheric conditions that occur locally over short periods of time—from minutes to hours or days. Familiar examples include rain, snow, clouds, winds, floods or thunderstorms.
                  Climate, on the other hand, refers to the long-term regional or even global average of temperature, humidity and rainfall patterns over seasons, years or decades.</p>
                <p>Global warming is the result of greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, they trap the sun’s heat. 
                  This leads to global warming and climate change. 
                  The world is now warming faster than at any point in recorded history.</p>
                <p>What are the 4 main causes of global warming?</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Burning coal, oil and gas produces carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide.</li>
                  <li>Deforestation.</li>
                  <li>Increasing livestock farming.</li>
                  <li>Fluorinated gases are emitted from equipment and products that use these gases.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth’s climate system observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere. The term is frequently used interchangeably with the term climate change, though the latter refers to both human- and naturally produced warming and the effects it has on our planet. It is most commonly measured as the average increase in Earth’s global surface temperature.</p>

                <p>World governments are trying their best to stop global warming. But did you know that in the smallest things we can contribute in helping saving the world?</p>
                <p>Read my blogs and watch my videos on how to help save the world! <br> no thing is small if it is done by many!</p>
